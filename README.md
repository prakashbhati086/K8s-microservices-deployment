| Technology | Purpose                  | Why I Chose It                          |

Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment
bash
# Install required tools (Windows using Chocolatey)
choco install docker-desktop kubernetes-cli minikube nodejs

# Start Minikube (local Kubernetes)
minikube start --memory=4096 --cpus=2

# Verify everything works
kubectl get nodes
docker version
node --version

Step 2: Create the Frontend Service
Why this service? This is what users interact with - the login and signup pages.

Create folder structure:

text
web-service/
├── app.js
├── package.json
├── Dockerfile
├── k8s/
│   ├── deployment.yml
│   └── service.yml
├── views/
│   ├── home.ejs
│   ├── login.ejs
│   └── signup.ejs
└── public/
    └── styles.css

The main application file handles:

Serving web pages

Processing form submissions

Talking to the auth service

Managing user sessions

Step 3: Create the Authentication Service
Why separate? Authentication logic is complex and might need different scaling than the frontend.

This service handles:

User registration with validation

Password hashing for security

User login verification

Database operations

API endpoints for other services

Step 4: Set Up MongoDB Database
Why MongoDB? It's document-based, which is perfect for user profiles with varying information.

Container approach: Instead of installing MongoDB on my computer, I run it in a container

Persistent storage: User data survives even if the container restarts

Connection: Services connect using Kubernetes internal networking

Key Learning: Databases in containers need special care for data persistence.

Step 5: Dockerize Everything
Why Docker? "It works on my machine" becomes "it works everywhere."

Each service gets its own Dockerfile:

Starts with a base image (Node.js)

Copies code into the container

Installs dependencies

Sets up the runtime environment

Key Learning: Smaller images = faster deployments. Use Alpine Linux base images.

Step 6: Deploy to Kubernetes
Why Kubernetes? It manages containers automatically - starts them, restarts if they fail, distributes traffic.

For each service, I created:

Deployment: Manages replicas and updates

Service: Provides network access and load balancing

ConfigMaps/Secrets: Configuration and sensitive data

Key Learning: Kubernetes makes applications self-healing and scalable without manual intervention.

🎯 Services Breakdown:

Web Service (Port 4000): The website users see

Auth Service (Port 3000): Handles login/signup logic

MongoDB (Port 27017): Stores user information

Step 7: Set Up CI/CD with Jenkins
Why Jenkins? Automated deployments mean fewer mistakes and faster releases.

Pipeline stages:

Code Change → Git commit triggers build

Build → Create new Docker images

Test → Run health checks

Deploy → Update Kubernetes with new images

Verify → Ensure everything works
Key Learning: Every code change automatically becomes a new deployment with zero manual steps.
Step 8: Add Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
Why monitoring? You can't improve what you don't measure.

What I monitor:

How many users are signing up

How fast the login process is

If any errors are happening

Server resource usage (CPU, memory)

Database performance

Key Learning: Good monitoring catches problems before users notice them.

 What I Learned Building This
Technical Skills
Microservices Architecture: Breaking big problems into smaller, manageable pieces

Container Orchestration: Kubernetes automatically manages application lifecycle

DevOps Practices: Code → Build → Test → Deploy pipeline automation

🎯 Real-World Applications
This project teaches patterns used by companies like:

Netflix: Microservices for different features (user management, recommendations, streaming)

Amazon: Each AWS service is essentially a microservice

Google: Kubernetes was created by Google for their massive scale

Spotify: Different teams can deploy their services independently

🚧 Challenges I Faced & Solutions
Challenge 1: Services Couldn't Talk to Each Other
Problem: Frontend couldn't connect to auth service
Solution: Learned Kubernetes service discovery and DNS
Lesson: Container networking is different from regular networking

Challenge 2: Database Connection Failures
Problem: Auth service couldn't connect to MongoDB
Solution: Proper service configuration and health checks
Lesson: Always implement retry logic and health checks

Challenge 3: Monitoring Setup Complexity
Problem: Too many configuration files for Prometheus/Grafana
Solution: Used Helm charts for simplified deployment
Lesson: Use existing tools and packages when available
